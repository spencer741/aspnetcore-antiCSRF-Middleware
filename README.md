# aspnetcore antiCSRF Middleware Boilerplate

Full test project will be added soon. src is available. Lot of changes to be made to amend ugly code and promote good practice, so start pulling!

Note: when DBIO is necessary in code, just place a comment /*Custom Data Adapter call*/ or create a dumb variable for now.
